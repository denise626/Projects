		<p>We began our vision in 1983 when abandoned dogs and cats were dropped off at our home out in the country and we decided to help them. Many of the the animals were dropped off because of disease, pregnancy, and behavioral problems. Instead of calling the animal control officers or taking them to animal shelters (where all of them would be euthanized), we took the animals in and became their advocates. Harrelson Kennels believes in giving every pet an opportunity to thrive and survive. Over the years, we have taken care of many kittens and cats that have developed FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) which is an equivalent to AIDS in their human counterparts. Feline leukemia virus and distemper are also other maladies that have been commonly found in the abandoned felines. Our dogs have also been subject to many misfortunate diseases and illnesses such as liver diseases, cancer, parvo, heartworms, and diabetes. These are just a few of the serious issues that our pets have had to overcome throughout the years. Many have conquered some of these diseases but many have passed away from them. We believe in giving every pet a chance to live life to its fullest with loving care no matter the situation, but we also do not allow pets to suffer needlessly. To be able to fulfill this promise to them, a veterinarian is on call 24 hours a day.</p> 
		
		<p>Fostering is also an excellent opportunity for us to help pets find their perfect family. In order to foster a pet, we do criminal background checks and have individuals fill out an application requiring three personal references that can attest to the individual's character. Before the fostering process, home visits are made to inspect the pet's potential home. At that time we will decide if the pet will be able to have a positive fostering experience in that environment.</p>

		<p>If you have other questions regarding Harrelson Kennels or our fostering program, head over to our contact page and send us a message. We would love to hear from you and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
